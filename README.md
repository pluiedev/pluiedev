### Hi there 👋
I code things.

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on** Minecraft mods and indie games, of my own and with [@ReMod-Games](https://github.com/ReMod-Games) and [@QuantumFusionMC](https://github.com/QuantumFusionMC)

- 🌱 **I’m currently learning** the dark wizardry of advanced Rust and repulsive hacks with JVMs

- :book: **I like and often use** Kotlin, Rust and Ruby; I sometimes use Java for modding stuff but I think Kotlin's a lot better.

- 📫 **How to reach me:**
    - My Discord server where I hang out and post updates: [here](https://discord.gg/NeNfePzCx8)
    - Alternatively, you can also contact me directly via Discord `leocth#3409` (friend requests and DMs open)
    - Or my email linked in the profile page (I don't check that often though)

- 😄 **Pronouns:** he/him

- 🕙 **Timezone:** China Standard Time (UTC+8)

- 🗨️ **Languages I speak/use:** English/简体中文

- ⚡ Fun fact: this page took me like 15 minutes to fill out
