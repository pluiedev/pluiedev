### Hi there 👋
I currently develop Minecraft mods, of my own and with [@ReMod-Studios](https://github.com/ReMod-Studios) and [@alphaqu](https://github.com/alphaqu)

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on** [Luminous Depths](https://github.com/ReMod-Studios/lumidep-java) and [datakenesis](https://github.com/ReMod-Studios/datakenesis) for [ReMod](https://github.com/ReMod-Studios), and [DashLoader](https://github.com/alphaqu/DashLoader) with [@alphaqu](https://github.com/alphaqu)

- 🌱 **I’m currently learning** the dark wizardry of advanced Rust and repulsive hacks with JVMs

- :book: **I like and often use** Kotlin, Rust and Ruby; I sometimes use Java for modding stuff but I think Kotlin's a lot better.

- 📫 **How to reach me:** via Discord `leocth#3409` (friend requests and DMs open), or my email linked in the profile page (I don't check that often though)

- 😄 **Pronouns:** he/him

- 🕙 **Timezone:** China Standard Time (UTC+8)

- 🗨️ **Languages I speak/use:** English/简体中文

- ⚡ Fun fact: this page took me like 15 minutes to fill out
